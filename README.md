# Sparkle-Template

-   My First Responsive Pug.js &amp; SCSS Webpage !
-   You can view the template's PSD file through this [link](https://www.graphberry.com/item/sparkle-free-multipurpose-tweb-emplate), It is free !
-   Works well on all devices.
-   I considered it as a practice material to apply what I have learned in Pug.js, SCSS and a bit of JavaScript.
-   You can view it live through this [link](https://philopaterhany.github.io/Sparkle-Template/).
-   I hope you like it.
